    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky">
        <b>Wayne Gretzky</b> Wayne Gretzky is a famous hockey player born in Brantford, Ontario on January 26th, 1961. &nbsp;He is known to be the greatest hockey player that ever played the game, thus his nickname "The Great One". &nbsp;He played 20 seasons in the NHL for four teams, including the Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers from 1979 to 1999. &nbsp;He still holds many statistical records in the NHL including most goals in a regular season being 92 goals scored. &nbsp;He retired in 1999 with the New York Rangers. &nbsp;His #99 was retired by the National Hockey League meaning that no other player may ever wear that number in the NHL again.
